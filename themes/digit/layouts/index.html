peek into the way of life and a powerful tool which can conquer great accomplishments. Our
prestigious institution strives to shape a generation that is capable to take up on the challenges put
forward by the modern world. We have always tried to inculcate divergent thinking and creativity
among our students. The Digital magazine crafted by the Department of Information Technology will
truly help unfold a wide spectrum of creative skills. The magazine is not only just a result of the
strenuous efforts of the editorial board and students but also the committed and supportive
management and staff. It is truly an achievement worth emulating.
I offer my well wishes to the department and hope to see more of such contributions.`

    text: `Dear all,

I am extremely proud to lead the Information Technology Department at Amal Jyothi College of
Engineering. Our department is dedicated to providing students with the knowledge and skills
necessary to succeed in the ever-evolving field of technology. Our faculty and staff work tirelessly to
ensure that our students receive the best education possible and are well-prepared to tackle the
challenges of the future.

We are thrilled to introduce our IT department&#39;s first-ever digital magazine, XXXX. This magazine
provides a platform for our students to showcase their creative potential and innovative thinking.
The articles in this edition cover a wide range of topics, from academics to society and literature. I
am confident that this magazine will not only inspire our students but also provide valuable insights
for readers about the latest technology trends.

We want to express my gratitude to the team that worked tirelessly to bring this magazine to life.
From the student editor to each team member, their dedication and teamwork were truly
impressive. This magazine would not have been possible without their hard work and commitment. I
am excited to see what future editions of XXXX will bring and how our team will continue to
collaborate to bring the best possible content to our readers.

Best regards,\

College of Engineering, are starting a digital magazine in this month of October 2022.
As we know the Program Outcomes (POs) in the outcome based education (OBE) paradigm form a
set of parameters indicative of the graduate’s potential to acquire competence to practice at the
appropriate level. Student magazines have a great role in attaining certain POs such as effective
communication by being able to comprehend and write effective reports, design documentation,
and make effective presentations. Also, they help for functioning effectively as an individual and as a
member or leader in diverse teams.

Student magazines aim to bring the creative and daring side of each student and help them to
express their thoughts and skills; and can be instrumental in shaping opinion, perspective, and
debate—all of which are invaluable when entering the workplace and contributing to society.
Students need an outlet for their creativity, ideas, and developing critical thinking skill. A digital
magazine can provide the basis to learn, embrace, or refine these skills.
I congratulate the staff and students who put painstaking effort in bringing out this first edition; and
I wish them the very best for its grand success.

    text: `Hello All,

In today’s world, a man with information has the power to turn the wheels of fortune. Information
technology has been the main catalyst to make the existence of mankind simpler, smoother and
easier. In fact, IT challenges the competence of individuals and motivates them to come up with
ideas that can transform the structure of human life. It gives me immense pleasure to introduce the
first ever magazine of Information Technology Department, Amal Jyothi College of Engineering in the
digital format.
XXXX&#39; provides a platform for our students to express their thoughts on various issues pertaining to
academics, society, literature etc. and ignites the minds to generate constructive inputs/ideas to
bring all round growth and development. Thus it was our job to ensure inspiring ideas are being
brought to the students of IT, by the students of IT itself. The spectrum of articles gives us a sense of
pride that our students possess creative, potential and novel thinking in ample measures. I applaud
the contributors for their stimulated thoughts and varied hues in the content delivered by them.

Our endeavor with each edition is to update you on the latest trends of technologies coming up and
flashing some light on the innovative minds of the youth today. Lastly, quoting my special thanks to
our Head of Department, Dr. Shiju George for his support and guidance all along, the departmental
faculty and non faculty members for being an inspiration.

A special acknowledgement is owed to the student editor and various team members for their
commendable job.Everything from the collection of articles right down to the final edits was smooth
sailing only because of their sheer support.I would like to thank every member without whose
contribution, this issue would not have been possible.

My best wishes to all the readers for scaling bigger success and achieving new heights in the coming
days.

text: `It gives us immense joy and satisfaction to finally introduce our very own digital magazine “ITerno”.
Just like the gods and the asuras churned the ocean of milk to extract the nectar, we have tried
to churn out creativity from the mass of our students.
Amidst the busy schedule of a 4-month semester, with 3-exams, practicals and all those
assignments and problem sheets that make you want to bang your
head on the wall, we tend to lose track of all the other simpler things
that we are capable of and the things that we could have been proud of.
So this time we have made an attempt to bring out the talents concealed within our students.
It publishes well-written technical and non-technical works . The content also includes
artworks in the form of drawings, photography, etc.
As you scan through, you will meet dedicated and talented students, in the
pages of this issue.
The budding talents of our department have expressed their
ideas and talents in a very creative way.
A lot of effort has gone into the making of it.
We hope you enjoy reading “ITerno”.`
