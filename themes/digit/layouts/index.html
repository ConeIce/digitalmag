      Education has never been just about learning certain subjects and doing
      well in exams; rather it is a peek into the way of life and a powerful
      tool which can conquer great accomplishments. Our prestigious institution
      strives to shape a generation that is capable to take up on the challenges
      put forward by the modern world. We have always tried to inculcate
      divergent thinking and creativity among our students. The Digital magazine
      crafted by the Department of Information Technology will truly help unfold
      a wide spectrum of creative skills. The magazine is not only just a result
      of the strenuous efforts of the editorial board and students but also the
      committed and supportive management and staff. It is truly an achievement
      worth emulating. I offer my well wishes to the department and hope to see
      more of such contributions.

      to ensure that our students receive the best education possible and are

      introduce our IT department's first-ever digital magazine, XXXX. This
      magazine provides a platform for our students to showcase their creative
      potential and innovative thinking. The articles in this edition cover a
      wide range of topics, from academics to society and literature. I am
      confident that this magazine will not only inspire our students but also
      provide valuable insights for readers about the latest technology trends.
      We want to express my gratitude to the team that worked tirelessly to
      bring this magazine to life. From the student editor to each team member,
      their dedication and teamwork were truly impressive. This magazine would
      not have been possible without their hard work and commitment. I am
      excited to see what future editions of XXXX will bring and how our team
      will continue to collaborate to bring the best possible content to our
      readers.

      It gives us immense joy and satisfaction to finally introduce our very own
      digital magazine “ITerno”. Just like the gods and the asuras churned the
      ocean of milk to extract the nectar, we have tried to churn out creativity
      from the mass of our students. Amidst the busy schedule of a 4-month
      semester, with 3-exams, practicals and all those assignments and problem
      sheets that make you want to bang your head on the wall, we tend to lose
      track of all the other simpler things that we are capable of and the
      things that we could have been proud of. So this time we have made an
      attempt to bring out the talents concealed within our students. It
      publishes well-written technical and non-technical works . The content
      also includes artworks in the form of drawings, photography, etc. As you
      scan through, you will meet dedicated and talented students, in the pages
      of this issue. The budding talents of our department have expressed their
      ideas and talents in a very creative way. A lot of effort has gone into
      the making of it. We hope you enjoy reading “ITerno”.
