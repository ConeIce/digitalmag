How do you describe laughter? Laughing is defined as "showing emotion (such as mirth, joy or scorn) with a chuckle or explosive vocal sound."

Is laughter an emotion?

Most experts consider it to be. In fact, it's often called a "contagious emotion" because it tends to spread from person to person.

In terms of what takes place in our bodies when we laugh, there's actually still a lot of unknowns. According to Psychology Today, "Although laughter is one of the distinguishing features of human beings, little is known about the mechanisms behind it."

We know that people tend to laugh in several scenarios, including:

- To communicate to others we think something is funny
- Due to embarrassment and social discomfort
- To facilitate bonding and understanding across groups of people

Is laughing a sign of happiness?

Laughing tends to occur more among people who are already happy, and it can also make you feel happier too.

In humans and primates, laughing releases endorphins and other "feel good" chemicals that help strengthen social bonds, reduce pain and increase motivation, all of which contribute to overall mental/emotional well-being. Laughing even burns calories, although not as much as most types of moderate exercise.

When you laugh, you naturally buffer yourself against some of the damaging effects of stress, since laughing puts the brakes on your defensive stress responses, including our "fight or flight" response. Laughing also draws others closer to you, since the happier you appear, the more those around you feel happy too.

What are the benefits of laughing?

Laughter has been shown in studies to contribute to dozens of health benefits. In fact, laughing more often may even help you live longer.

One study done in 2016 found that people with a strong sense of humor had a longer life expectancy than those who didn't laugh often due to reduced risk for issues like heart disease and infections.

Laughing is associated with some of the following health benefits:

- Improves your mood, reducing anxiety symptoms, anger, resentment, depression, and sadness
- Boosts your immune system by decreasing circulating stress hormones and increases immune cells and infection-fighting antibodies
- Relaxes muscles and relieves tension
- Increases blood flow/circulation and can help protect against heart disease
- Improves mental and physical resilience (some even compare it to exercise in this regard!)
- Decreases pain
- Boosts social bonds between friends and attraction between men and women; in fact, women are sometimes called greater "laughter appreciators" because they tend to laugh over 120 percent more on average than men do
- Helps you to forgive sooner and gives you a new perspective when dealing with challenges
- Improves alertness, productivity, and memory, including in the workplace
- Gives you a generally more positive, optimistic outlook, which you bring to new and challenging situations

Drawing upon what we know about how laughing usually occurs and how it benefits us, here are some ways to bring more laughs into your everyday life:

1. Best way to have a laugh is spending your time with your buddies/gangs. I'm sure they'll have something funny to do whenever everyone is together. (Talking from real-life experience)
2. Pay attention to what other people in your social circle think is funny. Laughing together is a great way to build stronger relationships, which is powerful at reducing loneliness-related stress.
3. While socializing, put your phone away and try to avoid distractions. The more present you are with others, the more you'll relish in other people's jokes and
