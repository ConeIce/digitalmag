The field of artificial intelligence has grown significantly over the past ten years. Large volumes of data were acquired by consumer internet providers and utilised to train potent machine learning programmes. For many commercial applications, machine learning algorithms are widely accessible; some are even open source.

Despite a general lack of familiarity, artificial intelligence is a technology that is revolutionising all aspects of existence. It is a versatile tool that helps individuals to reconsider how we combine information, analyse data, and use the insights obtained to enhance decision-making. We intend to explain AI to a group of decision-makers, opinion-formers, and interested observers through the course of this thorough overview, as well as to show how AI is already changing the world and posing significant issues for society, the economy, and governance.

According to machine learning pioneer Andrew Ng, concentrating on the calibre of the data used to power AI systems would help unleash its full potential. Ng promotes "data-centric AI," which he defines as "the discipline of systematically engineering the data needed to build a successful AI system." Ng highlights a few issues, including: Ad hoc curation, Differences in Labelling, and Emphasis on Big Data.

AI is the key to a wonderful future where we will all be able to make better judgements because of data and machines that comprehend our reality.
