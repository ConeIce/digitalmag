Hello All,

In today’s world, a man with information has the power to turn the wheels of fortune. Information
technology has been the main catalyst to make the existence of mankind simpler, smoother and
easier. In fact, IT challenges the competence of individuals and motivates them to come up with
ideas that can transform the structure of human life. It gives me immense pleasure to introduce the
first ever magazine of Information Technology Department, Amal Jyothi College of Engineering in the
digital format.
XXXX&#39; provides a platform for our students to express their thoughts on various issues pertaining to
academics, society, literature etc. and ignites the minds to generate constructive inputs/ideas to
bring all round growth and development. Thus it was our job to ensure inspiring ideas are being
brought to the students of IT, by the students of IT itself. The spectrum of articles gives us a sense of
pride that our students possess creative, potential and novel thinking in ample measures. I applaud
the contributors for their stimulated thoughts and varied hues in the content delivered by them.

Our endeavor with each edition is to update you on the latest trends of technologies coming up and
flashing some light on the innovative minds of the youth today. Lastly, quoting my special thanks to
our Head of Department, Dr. Shiju George for his support and guidance all along, the departmental
faculty and non faculty members for being an inspiration.

A special acknowledgement is owed to the student editor and various team members for their
commendable job.Everything from the collection of articles right down to the final edits was smooth
sailing only because of their sheer support.I would like to thank every member without whose
contribution, this issue would not have been possible.

My best wishes to all the readers for scaling bigger success and achieving new heights in the coming
days.

Thankfully
