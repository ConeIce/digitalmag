Education has never been just about learning certain subjects and doing well in exams; rather it is a
peek into the way of life and a powerful tool which can conquer great accomplishments. Our
prestigious institution strives to shape a generation that is capable to take up on the challenges put
forward by the modern world. We have always tried to inculcate divergent thinking and creativity
among our students. The Digital magazine crafted by the Department of Information Technology will
truly help unfold a wide spectrum of creative skills. The magazine is not only just a result of the
strenuous efforts of the editorial board and students but also the committed and supportive
management and staff. It is truly an achievement worth emulating.
I offer my well wishes to the department and hope to see more of such contributions.
