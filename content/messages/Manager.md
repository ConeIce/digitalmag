Dear all,

I am pleased to announce the launch of the first-ever digital magazine from the Information Technology Department at Amal Jyothi College of Engineering, ITerno. This is a significant milestone for the department, and I am proud of the hard work and dedication of the IT Association in bringing this magazine to fruition.

ITerno provides a platform for our students to showcase their creative potential and innovative thinking. The magazine covers a wide range of topics, from academics to society and literature, and provides valuable insights into the latest technology trends. I am confident that this magazine will inspire and inform readers and serve as a testament to the excellence of our IT Department.

I want to extend my congratulations to everyone involved in this project, from the content team to the media team, the technical team, and the editors. Your hard work and dedication have truly paid off, and I am proud to see the IT Department and the IT Association achieve such a remarkable feat.

Once again, congratulations to the IT Department and the IT Association on the launch of ITerno. I look forward to seeing the continued success of the department and the magazine in the future.

Best regards,

Fr. Dr. Paickatt
College Manager
Amal Jyothi College of Engineering
