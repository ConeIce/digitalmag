It gives us immense joy and satisfaction to finally introduce our very own digital magazine “ITerno”.
Just like the gods and the asuras churned the ocean of milk to extract the nectar, we have tried
to churn out creativity from the mass of our students.
Amidst the busy schedule of a 4-month semester, with 3-exams, practicals and all those
assignments and problem sheets that make you want to bang your
head on the wall, we tend to lose track of all the other simpler things
that we are capable of and the things that we could have been proud of.
So this time we have made an attempt to bring out the talents concealed within our students.
It publishes well-written technical and non-technical works . The content also includes
artworks in the form of drawings, photography, etc.
As you scan through, you will meet dedicated and talented students, in the
pages of this issue.
The budding talents of our department have expressed their
ideas and talents in a very creative way.
A lot of effort has gone into the making of it.
We hope you enjoy reading “ITerno”.
