Amal Jyothi College of Engineering has always stood out, not just because of its achievements as an educational institute, but because of the combined effort of its students and staff, working tirelessly to introduce new ideas and adapt to the changes the world undergoes. Recognizing how the modern world has shifted in favor of digital sources for information and expression, the Department of Information Technology has proposed an ingenious concept â€“ the creation of a digital magazine to showcase the talents and creativity of every student.
