I am happy to note that the students of the Information Technology Department, Amal Jyothi
College of Engineering, are starting a digital magazine in this month of October 2022.
As we know the Program Outcomes (POs) in the outcome based education (OBE) paradigm form a
set of parameters indicative of the graduate’s potential to acquire competence to practice at the
appropriate level. Student magazines have a great role in attaining certain POs such as effective
communication by being able to comprehend and write effective reports, design documentation,
and make effective presentations. Also, they help for functioning effectively as an individual and as a
member or leader in diverse teams.

Student magazines aim to bring the creative and daring side of each student and help them to
express their thoughts and skills; and can be instrumental in shaping opinion, perspective, and
debate—all of which are invaluable when entering the workplace and contributing to society.
Students need an outlet for their creativity, ideas, and developing critical thinking skill. A digital
magazine can provide the basis to learn, embrace, or refine these skills.
I congratulate the staff and students who put painstaking effort in bringing out this first edition; and
I wish them the very best for its grand success.
