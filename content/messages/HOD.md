Dear all,

I am extremely proud to lead the Information Technology Department at Amal Jyothi College of
Engineering. Our department is dedicated to providing students with the knowledge and skills
necessary to succeed in the ever-evolving field of technology. Our faculty and staff work tirelessly to
ensure that our students receive the best education possible and are well-prepared to tackle the
challenges of the future.

We are thrilled to introduce our IT departments first-ever digital magazine. This magazine
provides a platform for our students to showcase their creative potential and innovative thinking.
The articles in this edition cover a wide range of topics, from academics to society and literature. I
am confident that this magazine will not only inspire our students but also provide valuable insights
for readers about the latest technology trends.

We want to express my gratitude to the team that worked tirelessly to bring this magazine to life.
From the student editor to each team member, their dedication and teamwork were truly
impressive. This magazine would not have been possible without their hard work and commitment. I
am excited to see what future editions will bring and how our team will continue to
collaborate to bring the best possible content to our readers.

Best regards,
Dr Shiju George
HOD, Information Technology
Amal Jyothi College of Engineering
