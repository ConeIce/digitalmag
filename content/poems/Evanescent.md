Chasing Eternity\
As the sky embraces the earth\
As the seawaves embraces the shore\
We standby amusing its beauty\
Wishing to relish evermore ...\
Their bond is their beauty\
That stays a mystery to all\
For how long it can love each other\
Yh it's magic lie in their eternity.\
What if I was a star as such\
What if I was the moon\
Just have no worries and no losses\
Cus love from the sun is everlasting.\
As the dandelions dance joyfully\
At that moment of happiness\
But a moment comes of sadness\
With petals withering off...\
As it is, happiness come and go\
People do come and go\
Nothing is everlasting\
But the memories are always abiding...\
Though some may hurt\
Or may put on a smile\
Whatever it could be\
We're lucky to have such feelings...\
Cherish some happy moments\
Remind us of some sorrow lessons\
Some are meant to be treasure in us\
And let them stay forever in us...\
To the stars above\
And the dandelions below\
I've no clue for how long I'll amuse at you\
Cus one day I too will vanish away\
And wish to be one among the stars like you.
