Once you fell in it.\
You will never need to know,\
That love completes the feeling....\
Love is what we need,\
Love is what we have,\
Love is what we are\
Love never hurts anybody\
It is ourselves who hurts love\
The feeling of love starts from the birth\
It's the first love\
It's the true love\
It's the 'Mother'.\
Perfect love enables one to live without happiness\
And if when happiness accompanies love\
Ah! Then it's 'Heaven'
