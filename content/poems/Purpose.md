The starless night which had come to be\
Covered by a thin veil of clouds\
Like the face of the moon goddess\
Without any blemish

The wind didn't blow \
nor did the insects chirp\
As silent as nights could be\
As silent as a child could sleep

I turn in my bed\
Searching for my purpose\
 in a place I spent most of times\
Hugging my sheets,\
The very sheets that knew \
the countless days and tear filled eyes

As I slowly open my eyes\
I wake up \
from a dream of desires and sadness

A dream,\
just a wish to come true\
Or a dream I could never wake up from\
I close my eyes again\
And go back to the days of past\
When the stars shone so bright

The wind blew gently at the back of my neck\
The soft chirping of the insects\
All felt like a motherly embrace\
An embrace I never wanted to wake up from\
I prayed and faded of into the abyss\
 of care and love

I saw my mother's arms stretched out\
On the top of the hill she sat\
The nights heavenly breeze\
Whispered in my ear the story of love

My tears that rolled down my cheek\
We're caught by webs\
And they sparkled like the star filled skies\
As I realized the beauty in pain

As I felt a sense of relief\
I climb the mountain to reunite with my\
Mother that Took away my grief\
I fell on my knees to meet her loving embrace

I slept in my mothers arms\
And slept and slept and slept...
