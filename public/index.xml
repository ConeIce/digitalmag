      <description>Once you fell in it.
You will never need to know,
That love completes the feeling&amp;hellip;.
Love is what we need,
Love is what we have,
Love is what we are
Love never hurts anybody
It is ourselves who hurts love
The feeling of love starts from the birth
It&amp;rsquo;s the first love
It&amp;rsquo;s the true love
It&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;lsquo;Mother&amp;rsquo;.
Perfect love enables one to live without happiness
And if when happiness accompanies love</description>
